AIM OF THE PROJECT: To make a tool that takes video as an input, analyses the video and returns  open-source information about the people present in the video.
What does it do so far?
1. Analyzes the people from the video and compares from the backend to retrieve names.
2. Webscrapes for social media links and other links (they are segregated) using the retrieved names.
3. Tries to find correlation between names (only of the basis of name similarity so far).
